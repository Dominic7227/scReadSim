**scReadSim**: a single-cell multi-omics simulator that generates sequencing reads
==================================================================================

scReadSim is a single-cell synthetic reads simulator for multiple omics data. It starts from the BAM file of the input sequencing data and generates the synthetic dataset using BAM or FASTQ formats. The synthetic data generated by scReadSim resembles the real data in both the count and read level.
