**scReadSim**:  a single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq read simulator
=================================================================

scReadSim is a single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq read simulator. It starts from the BAM file of the input sequencing data and generates the synthetic dataset using BAM or FASTQ formats. The synthetic data generated by scReadSim resembles the real data in both the count and read level.
